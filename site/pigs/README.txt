Place sample pig images here.

Instructions:
1. Copy JPG files from /home/colloh/Downloads/Pigs into this folder.
2. Reference them in pages using <img src="./pigs/FILENAME.jpg" alt="Pig" /> when serving /site as root.
3. If you serve the project from repository root and keep /site nested, use src="/site/pigs/FILENAME.jpg".

For high performance, consider optimizing images (e.g., convert to WebP and limit width to ~1200px for hero, ~400px for cards).
